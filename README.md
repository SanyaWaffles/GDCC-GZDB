GDCC-ACC Configs for GZDoom Builder Bugfix

Some people, myself included, were confused on how to get GDCC-ACC to work with GZDoom Builder (specifically the continuation project).

Rather than be the only person with a working config I decided to show what I did. Basically this ensures it's not messed up upon GZDB:BF updating.

Supply your own GDCC-ACC binaries (tested with both 64 and 32 bit on Windows 10 Enterprise version).

Recently I got it to work with error reporting back to GZDB:BF as well, so any error should be reported (though I'm not sure it reports errors via line number reporting. Maybe people can help me out).
